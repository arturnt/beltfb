A jQuery Deferreds enabled Facebook library wrapper. This fills in the gaps in the Facebook's api. And offers the following:
* Converts an FB event into a jQuery event("init.fb").
* All FB API calls are wrapped in Deferreds calls accodring to JS/Commons 1.0. This allows you to do some amazing things, 
like loading multiple things at the same time.
* More to come!
